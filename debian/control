Description: publish command line shell through AJAX interface
 Shellinabox can export arbitrary command line programs to any JavaScript
 enabled web browser. By default, it prompts for username and password
 and then exports a SSL/TLS encrypted login shell. Shellinabox provides
 a VT100 compatible terminal emulator that runs within any modern browser.
 .
 ShellInABox links libssl dynamically, so libssl must be installed
 either manually or as a dependency of another package for SSL support
 to be available.
